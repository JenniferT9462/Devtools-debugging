# Devtools-debugging
## Day 1
There is a JS file and HTML file that have several errors. I will locate these errors with the devTools in Chrome browser and fix all errors. 
## Day 2
Today I will inspect a web page with ten secret messages. And I will then record these messages in a markdown file. 
## Day 3
Today we will look for more secret messages but, this time there will be errors to navigate in the code in order to see the secret messages. Then, we will record the errors and secret messages. 
## Day 4
This day we will be looking at our capstone from last pathway and running test to see how well it performs. We will take screenshots of each test and suggest ways to make the website operate better. 
## Day 5
